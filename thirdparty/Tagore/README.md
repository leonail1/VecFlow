Tagore: Scalable Graph Indexing using GPUs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
===============================================================================
Tagore is a library that accelerates scalable graph-based index construction for approximate nearest neighbor search using GPUs. It provides user-friendly Python APIs, enabling seamless integration of GPU acceleration into index construction workflows. 
Tagore focuses on the acceleration of the mainstream refinement-based graph indexes such as NSG, NSSG, Vamana, CAGRA, etc. An efficient kNN graph construction algorithm GNN-Descent, a unified pruning acceleration framework, and an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk pipeline tailored for billion-scale indexing are included in Tagore. 

Project Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the project root directory, do the following:

```
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
After that, a Python package named Tagore will be compiled and stored in the build directory.

 Python Example
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Example 1: constructing a million-scale index using NSG 
 ```python
import Tagore

k = 96
vector_num = 1000000
dim = 128
final_degree = 32
m = 64

# Initialization: constructing a kNN graph
gpuPtrs = Tagore.GNN_descent(k, vector_num, dim, 10, 'sift_base.fvecs')

# Pruning: refine the kNN graph using NSG
Tagore.Pruning(k, vector_num, dim, final_degree, m, gpuPtrs, 'NSG')
```

 * Example 2: constructing a million-scale index using NSG (CFS version) 
 ```python
import Tagore

k = 96
vector_num = 1000000
dim = 128
final_degree = 32
m = 64

# Initialization: constructing a kNN graph
gpuPtrs = Tagore.GNN_descent(k, vector_num, dim, 10, 'sift_base.fvecs')

# Pruning: refine the kNN graph using NSG; the underlying implementation follows the CFS procedure 
Tagore.Pruning_with_CFS(k, vector_num, dim, final_degree, m, gpuPtrs, 'path', 'dist', 1.0)
```

* Example 3: constructing a billion-scale index using Vamana
```python
import Tagore

devicelist = [0, 1, 2, 3] # using 4 GPUs
dim = 96
k = 64
cluster_num = 400
max_points = 5000000
data_path_prefix = '../data/cluster'
local_index_path_prefix = '../index/local_graph'
index_store_path = '../index/final_index.vamana.gpu'
max_degree = 22
buffer_size = 30
vector_num = 1000000000
center_path = '../data/centers.bin'
threshold = 1.2
final_degree = 32
m = 64

Tagore.largeIndex(devicelist, dim, k, cluster_num, max_points, data_path_prefix, local_index_path_prefix, index_store_path, max_degree, buffer_size, vector_num, center_path, threshold, final_degree, m)
```

Extension to Other Refinement-based Indexes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, Tagore has 5 built-in indexing methods: [NSG](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p461-fu.pdf), [Vamana](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/09853c7fb1d3f8ee67a61b6bf4a7f8e6-Abstract.html), [CAGRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15136), [NSSG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06146), and [DPG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8681160). These 5 pruning strategies represent foundational pruning methods that influence many others. Therefore, the current implementation of the CFS framework supports the extension to a wide range of strategies with minimal changes.  

For existing methods that can reuse the built-in parameter options, we use two examples to illustrate how to implement a pruning strategy by adding a few lines of code. Both examples collect kNN candidates using the Collect operation (the last k candidates with 'path' parameter in Algorithm 2) and apply the incremental computing model (Figure 6) for filtering. 

(1) $\alpha$-pruning strategy [[VLDB'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01231)] 

Add the pruning condition as listed below into `./src/Tagore_src.cu`:
```cpp
// d_vw, d_uv, d_uw are the square of the distances between nodes u, v, w; threshold = cos(alpha)
__device__ float alpha_filter(float d_vw, float d_uv, float d_uw, float threshold){ 
    return (((d_vw - d_uv < 0) | (d_uw - d_uv < 0) | ((d_vw + d_uw - d_uv) / 2 / sqrt(d_vw * d_uw) < threshold)) ? -1.0 : 1.0);
}
```
  This function can be passed as a parameter to the Filter operation, without any other modification of the Filter function. 

(2) $\tau$-MNG [[SIGMOD'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3588908)]

Add the pruning condition as listed below into `./src/Tagore_src.cu`:
```cpp
// d_vw, d_uv, d_uw are the square of the distances between nodes u, v, w; tau is a parameter set by the user
__device__ float tau_filter(float d_vw, float d_uv, float d_uw, float tau){ 
    return (((d_uw - d_uv < 0) | (d_vw - d_uv + 3 * tau < 0)) ? -1.0 : 1.0);
}
```
  Besides this function, we need to add one line of code in the Filter function within `./src/Tagore_src.cu` as below  
```cpp
......
while(cur_nei < FINAL_DEGREE) {
    // the added line
    if(cur_nei_dis <= 3 * tau) continue; // cur_nei_dis is the distance between nodes u and v
......
}
```
For potential newly proposed algorithms beyond the implementation of the built-in options, one can override the `Collect` or `Filter` functions within the CFS framework.
